                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.[1] Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898,[2] more than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail,[3] of the millions of types of viruses in the environment.[4] Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity.[5][6] The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology.<br><br>When infected, a host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or virions, consisting of: (i) the genetic material, i.e. long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside envelope of lipids. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope as they are one hundredth the size of most bacteria.<br><br>The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction.[7] Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life",[8] and as replicators.[9]<br><br>Viruses spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. Influenza viruses are spread by coughing and sneezing. Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its "host range". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.[10]<br><br>Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, HPV infection, and viral hepatitis, evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Several antiviral drugs have been developed.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Source: WIKIPEDIA-Virus</strong></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[10] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic.[11][12] As of 17 May 2020, more than 4.63 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. More than 1.69 million people have recovered.[9]<br><br>Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.[6][7][13] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to an unusual form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely precipitated by cytokine storm,[14]multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.[15][16][17] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[6][18]<br><br>The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.[7][19][21] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.[7] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[7][19] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.[7][19] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[22] Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.[23][24]<br><br>Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[8][25][26] In addition, the use of a face covering is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.[27][28] Recommendations for face covering use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending for them, some recommending against them, and others requiring their use.[28][29][30] There is limited evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community.[7]<br><br>According to the World Health Organization, there are no available vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19.[7] On 1 May 2020, the United States gave Emergency Use Authorization to the antiviral remdesivir for people hospitalized with severe COVID‑19.[31] Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.[32] The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID‑19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)[33][34] on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[12] Local transmission of the disease has occurred in most countries across all six WHO regions.[35]<br><br>Source: WIKIPEDIA - COVID-19</p>

                <div><br></div><div><br></div><div>News has reported that a Hantavirus has killed a person in China! Now, what is this Virus, and should we be worried?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>A Hantavirus is a virus ( Duh ) that looks like a blob of slime. It looks similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Like Coronavirus 2/Novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) and does rather similar things. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Like Coronavirus 2/Novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) kills, and so does the Hantavirus in question. Like ( Novel ) Influenza the Hantavirus is seasonal. That means that it is only active in a select period of time in the year. The hanta virus is not something to worry over, as this happens and repeats itself every year unlike the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Like Coronavirus 2/Novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 )  which is a very rare, once in a millennia happening.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Like Coronavirus 2/Novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) cases count hit 1500000, and also, from now on, I will report the news, and write about a virus type every day. My dad also introduced me to a website called GORK. It’s a coding platform that can run and process code, inside the site! That’s cool! I also ( 10 000 Characters!!! ) looked at some of googles code challenges, and hade a poke around id information about all kinds of different viruses, from Mega viruses to Influenza to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, lots of information. Now with my brain stuffed to the brim with worrying information, I will try my best to write about one virus type per day ( As mentioned above ) and try to provide all the information I can, to hopefully try and inform whoever reads my diary about different viruses!</div><div>____________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>INFLUENZA</div><div><br></div><div>I will talk about possibly the most common virus in the world, Influenza. I am talking about a mix of all three strains of Influenza, and my information is very basic, go check out the World health organisation’s website for detailed info, now, I am getting derailed and off track.</div><div><br></div><div>Influenza mainly gives you an unpleasant fever and makes you feel tired and weak foe a few weeks, and you also feel very cold all the time.</div><div><br></div><div>This is the full list, with Google as the source.</div><div><br></div><div>People may experience:</div><div>Pain areas: in the muscles</div><div>Cough: can be dry or with phlegm</div><div>Whole body: chills, dehydration, fatigue, fever, flushing, loss of appetite, body ache, or sweating</div><div>Nasal: congestion, runny nose, or sneezing</div><div>Also common: chest pressure, head congestion, headache, nausea, shortness of breath, sore throat, or swollen lymph nodes</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Most of these symptoms are pretty rare, and only show themselves in the sickest patients. It’s pretty similar to the symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  ( SARS ) related Coronavirus 2 aka Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19). This is the full list of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  ( SARS ) related Coronavirus 2 aka Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19)’s Symptoms from the World Health Organisation.</div><div><br></div><div>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</div><div><br></div><div>____________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>VACCINIA VIRUS</div><div><br></div><div>Description</div><div>Vaccinia virus is a large, complex, enveloped virus belonging to the poxvirus family. It has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome approximately 190 kbp in length, which encodes approximately 250 genes. The dimensions of the virion are roughly 360 × 270 × 250 nm, with a mass of approximately 5–10 fg. Wikipedia</div><div><br></div><div>Family: Poxviridae</div><div><br></div><div>Scientific name: Vaccinia virus</div><div><br></div><div>Rank: Species</div><div><br></div><div>Higher classification: Orthopoxvirus</div><div><br></div><div>Order: incertae sedis</div><div><br></div><div>Class: incertae sedis</div><div><br></div><div>This is what google has to say about the vaccinia virus…</div><div><br></div><div>Vaccinia Virus is actually the name for the smallpox vaccine, and could be related to cowpox. When I first researched this virus, I thought it was some form of pox, and I’m right! Sort of…&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used more extensively for human immunization than any other vaccine. For almost two centuries, VACV was employed to provide cross-protection against variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, until the disease was eradicated in the late 1970s. Since that time, continued research on VACV has produced a number of modified vaccines with improved safety profiles. Attenuation has been achieved through several strategies, including sequential passage in an alternative host, deletion of specific genes or genetic engineering of viral genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins. Some highly attenuated third- and fourth-generation VACV vaccines are now being considered for stockpiling against a possible re-introduction of smallpox through bioterrorism. Researchers have also taken advantage of the ability of the VACV genome to accommodate additional genetic material to produce novel vaccines against a wide variety of infectious agents, including a recombinant VACV encoding the rabies virus glycoprotein that is administered orally to wild animals. This review provides an in-depth examination of these successive generations of VACV vaccines, focusing on how the understanding of poxviral replication and viral gene function permits the deliberate modification of VACV immunogenicity and virulence.</div><div><br></div><div>____________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>EBOLA</div><div><br></div><div>Signs and Symptoms</div><div>Symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after contact with the virus, with an average of 8 to 10 days. The course of the illness typically progresses from “dry” symptoms initially (such as fever, aches and pains, and fatigue), and then progresses to “wet” symptoms (such as diarrhea and vomiting) as the person becomes sicker.</div><div><br></div><div>Primary signs and symptoms of Ebola often include some or several of the following:</div><div><br></div><div>Fever</div><div>Aches and pains, such as severe headache, muscle and joint pain, and abdominal (stomach) pain</div><div>Weakness and fatigue</div><div>Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and vomiting</div><div>Abdominal (stomach) pain</div><div>Unexplained hemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising</div><div>Other symptoms may include red eyes, skin rash, and hiccups (late stage).</div><div><br></div><div>Many common illnesses can have the same symptoms as EVD, including influenza (flu), malaria, or typhoid fever.</div><div><br></div><div>EVD is a rare but severe and often deadly disease. Recovery from EVD depends on good supportive clinical care and the patient’s immune response. Studies show that survivors of Ebola virus infection have antibodies (proteins made by the immune system that identify and neutralize invading viruses) that can be detected in the blood up to 10 years after recovery. Survivors are thought to have some protective immunity to the type of Ebola that sickened them. Ebola is a rare but deadly virus that causes fever, body aches, and diarrhea, and sometimes bleeding inside and outside the body.</div><div><br></div><div>As the virus spreads through the body, it damages the immune system and organs. Ultimately, it causes levels of blood-clotting cells to drop. This leads to severe, uncontrollable bleeding.</div><div><br></div><div>The disease was known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever but is now referred to as Ebola virus.</div><div><br></div><div>It kills up to 90% of people who are infected.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>____________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>ROSICELLA ( NOROVIRUS )</div><div><br></div><div>What is Root Fever?</div><div>Diaphragmatic disease is caused by infection with norovirus (and less frequently, sapovirus) and is one of the most common causes of acute gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. The name Roskilde disease is because the disease in Denmark was first described in Roskilde back in 1936.</div><div><br></div><div>It typically appears as a sudden nausea , vomiting and diarrhea of a few days duration. If you are otherwise healthy and healthy, the disease will not be dangerous. However, fluid loss and salt imbalance can rarely lead to more serious and life-threatening illness. This is especially true for smaller children and the elderly, as well as people with weakened immune systems.</div><div><br></div><div>Why do you get rosy?</div><div>Rosicella (norovirus) is extremely contagious and often causes an outbreak. The disease has a clear seasonal variation with most cases / outbreaks during the winter months. It is also called lethargy, as it typically affects many people at once.</div><div><br></div><div>Infection occurs especially in contexts where many people are gathered indoors, and is often seen, for example, in institutions, hotels, workplaces, hospitals and cruise ships, but also in families with children where the infection can happen from person to person or from contaminated surfaces. Infection is also often caused by foods that have been contaminated with viruses , and thus appear as outbreaks among restaurant guests, canteen users or the like.</div><div><br></div><div>It has been shown that when outbreaks occur, the infection is frequently spread from large kitchens, where kitchen employees may be infected but only have mild symptoms or possibly. only sick children at home.</div><div><br></div><div>What Are The Symptoms Of Root Sepsis?</div><div>The typical symptoms are diarrhea , vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain . Nausea and vomiting can occur quite suddenly.</div><div><br></div><div>A typical course of illness lasts 1-2 days, for children often longer, up to a week.</div><div><br></div><div>The period from being infected to becoming ill, i.e. the incubation period, is 1-2 days. You may feel very affected and weak while the disease is on, but the vast majority will quickly recover. Many simply want to get the disease in a milder form, which is mainly manifested by discomfort and nausea.</div><div><br></div><div>How is the diagnosis made?</div><div>If more than half of the patients vomit, disease duration is between 12-60 hours, incubation period between 24-48 hours, and no other explanation for the disease has been found (ie negative studies for bacteria and possibly parasites) probability that an outbreak is due to norovirus / sapovirus. Further cases among close contacts to infected are also an indication that the outbreak may be due to norovirus / sapovirus.</div><div><br></div><div>Norovirus / sapovirus is detected by so-called PCR analysis of stool samples. As the disease is self-limiting, it will not be necessary to examine the stool for most people. Diagnosis is mainly relevant in the case of outbreaks. It is difficult to detect norovirus in water or food, but can be done in certain circumstances.</div><div><br></div><div>How is rose-source sickness treated?</div><div>There is no actual treatment and antibiotics have no effect. You should drink plenty and also eat some food if you can. Frequent vomiting and / or frequent thin stools carry the risk of major fluid loss (dehydration) - and if the skin becomes dry or the eyes sunk (in smaller children), a doctor should be consulted.</div><div><br></div><div>What can you do yourself?</div><div>Foods that may be contaminated with norovirus should be discarded. Furthermore, infection is also prevented through thorough (hand) hygiene and cleaning. Norovirus is a stubborn virus that is resistant to desiccation and has little sensitivity to several disinfectants, such as alcohol, including hand rubbing. Instead, chlorine disinfectants should be used. Virus is also broken down by UV light (sunlight).</div><div><br></div><div>Noroviruses and sapoviruses are not infectious infections, but outbreaks of noroviruses are monitored by the Norwegian Serum Institute. If you suspect a food-related outbreak, you can report it to the local Food Region. Outbreaks can also be reported to the State Serum Institute.</div><div><br></div><div>Prospects for the future</div><div>There are several variants of norovirus that appear in the population at regular intervals, which is why you can get the infection several times, even in less time. If you have a weakened immune system you are more likely to get sick and the infection may be of longer duration.</div><div><br></div><div>Research is also being conducted on the use of so-called genome sequencing methods (mapping of whole viral genetic material) for even more accurate typing and identification of pathways of infection in norovirus outbreaks.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It says it was written by By Peter Henrik Andersen, Departmental Physician at Department for Infectious Epidemiology and Prevention, Statens Serum Institut</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This language seems to be Russian, and I will summarise it. This is the link to the (_______ssian/ish ?essay)</div><div><br></div><div>Norovirusinfektion (roskildesyge) - Statens Serum Institut</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Noroviruses are pretty infectious, and are fairly unpleasant to be infected with. They might cause a pandemic like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Like Coronavirus 2/Novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) but the death toll will be way lower.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>____________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>VARIOLA/SMALLPOX</div><div><br></div><div>Variola is a large brick-shaped virus measuring approximately 302 to 350 nanometers by 244 to 270 nm, with a single linear double stranded DNA genome 186 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end. The two classic varieties of smallpox are variola major and variola minor.</div><div>The parent disease is an: Viral Infection</div><div><br></div><div>The question of the origin of smallpox, one of the major menaces comparable to me constantly crashing my SSTOs to humankind, is a constant concern for the scientific community. Smallpox is caused by the agent referred to as the variola virus (VARV), which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus. In the last century, smallpox was declared eradicated from the human community; however, the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of new dangerous pathogens have yet to be unravelled, for instance , COVID 19 is really getting on all our nerves now. Evolutionary analyses of the molecular biological genomic data of various orthopoxviruses, involving a wide range of epidemiological and historical information about smallpox, have made it possible to date the emergence of VARV. Comparisons of the VARV genome to the genomes of the most closely related orthopoxviruses and the examination of the distribution their natural hosts’ ranges suggest that VARV emerged 3000 to 4000 years ago in the east of the African continent. The VARV evolution rate has been estimated to be approximately 2 × 10−6 substitutions/site/year for the central conserved genomic region and 4 × 10−6 substitutions/site/year for the synonymous substitutions in the genome. That is comparable with Influenza’s mutation rates. Presumably, the introduction of camels to Africa and the concurrent changes to the climate were the particular factors that triggered the divergent evolution of a cowpox-like ancestral virus and thereby led to the emergence of VARV.</div><div><br></div><div>Smallpox was one of the biggest killers of mankind, but now, eradication has been a great step forward in human tech.</div><div><br></div><div>____________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>VARICELLA-ZOSTER</div><div><br></div><div>(CHICKENPOX-ZOSTER)</div><div><br></div><div>The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is so named because it causes two distinct illnesses: varicella (chickenpox), following primary infection, and herpes zoster (shingles), following reactivation of latent virus. Varicella is a highly contagious infection with an incubation period of 10–21 days, most commonly 14–16 days, after which a characteristic rash appears. Acute varicella may be complicated by secondary bacterial skin infections, haemorrhagic complications, cerebellitis, encephalitis, and viral and bacterial pneumonia.1,2 About 5% of infections are subclinical.3</div><div><br></div><div>In unvaccinated populations, varicella is primarily a childhood illness with more than 80%–90% of the population in temperate countries developing clinical or serological infection by adolescence.4,5 Varicella is generally a benign, self-limiting illness in children, but morbidity and mortality rates are higher in adults,6 at the extremes of ages, and in the immunocompromised.7 Varicella also causes congenital disease that can severely affect newborns of non-immune women.8 Varicella-zoster virus has been responsible for a significant disease burden, including hospitalisations and deaths, in Australia and New Zealand.9 Routine use of varicella vaccine in childhood was first recommended in Australia in 2003, and, in November 2005, varicella vaccination was funded under the National Immunisation Program for all children using a single dose schedule at 18 months of age, and in a school-based catch-up program at 10–13 years of age for those with no history of disease or previous vaccination.</div><div><br></div><div>Herpes zoster or shingles is a sporadic disease, caused by reactivation of latent VZV in sensory nerve ganglia. It is usually self-limiting and is characterised by severe pain with dermatomal distribution, sometimes followed by post-herpetic neuralgia which can be chronic and debilitating in the elderly.10,11 Although herpes zoster can occur at any age, most cases occur after the age of 50 with the incidence of complications also increasing with age.12 However, children infected in utero or those who acquire varicella before the age of 1 year, and patients on immunosuppressive drugs or infected with human immunodeficiency virus, are also at increased risk of herpes zoster.13–15 A new herpes zoster vaccine which is over 60% effective in reducing the burden of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia16 has been available on the private market in Australia since 2008. The zoster vaccine is formulated from the same VZV strain (Oka-derived) as the licensed varicella (chickenpox) vaccines but is of higher potency (at least 14 times greater).</div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">____________________________________________________________</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>PICONAVIRUS</div><div><br></div><div>Clinical Manifestations</div><div><br></div><div>Most infections are inapparent. Some picornaviruses cause mild illnesses; a few serotypes give rise to serious conditions of the central nervous system, heart, skeletal muscles, and liver. These varied manifestations are presented under each of the five genera.</div><div><br></div><div>Structure</div><div><br></div><div>The picornavirus virion is an icosahedral, nonenveloped, small (22 to 30 nm) particle. The capsid proteins encase a sense RNA strand consisting of approximately 7,500 nucleotides. The RNA carries a covalently bound noncapsid viral protein (VPg) at its 5′ end and a polyadenylated tail at its 3′ end.</div><div><br></div><div>Classification and Antigenic Types</div><div><br></div><div>Classification is based on morphology, physicochemical and biologic properties, antigenic structures, genomic sequence and mode of replication. The family PICORNAVIRIDAE comprises five genera, namely, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, hepatoviruses, cardioviruses, and aphthoviruses.</div><div><br></div><div>The enteroviruses are subdivided into human polioviruses (1–3); human coxsackieviruses A1–22, 24 (CA1–22 and CA24, CA23 = echovirus 9); human coxsackieviruses (B1–6 (CB1–6); human echoviruses 1–7, 9, 11–27, 29–33 (E1–7, 9, 11–27, 29–33; E8=E1; E10 = Reovirus; E28 = Rhinovirus 1A and E34 = CA24 prime strain); human enterovirus 68–71 (EV68–71); vilyuish virus; simian enteroviruses 1–18 (SEV1–18); porcine enteroviruses 1–11 (PEV1–11); bovine enteroviruses 1–2 (BEV1–2).</div><div><br></div><div>Multiplication</div><div><br></div><div>Picornaviruses multiply in the cytoplasm, and their RNA acts as a messenger to synthesize viral macromolecules. Viral RNA replicates in complexes associated with cytoplasmic membranes via two distinct, partially double-stranded RNAs - the “replicative intermediates.” One complex uses the sense RNA strand, and the other uses the antisense RNA strand as template.</div><div><br></div><div>Pathogenesis</div><div><br></div><div>Enterovirus can replicate in epithelium of the nasopharynx and regional lymphoid tissue, conjunctiva, intestines, mesenteric nodes, and the reticuloendothelial system. Viremia may cause virus transfer to the spinal cord, brain, meninges, heart, liver, and skin. Some chronic enterovirus infections result in postviral fatigue syndrome. Rhinoviruses infect and replicate mainly in nasopharyngeal epithelium and regional lymph nodes. Hepatitis A virus replicates in the intestinal epithelium, viremia transports the virus to the liver where secondary virus multiplication in the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells results in infectious hepatitis A.</div><div><br></div><div>Host Defenses</div><div><br></div><div>Interferon and virus-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies are important in host defense. Neutralizing antibody confers serotype-specific immunity.</div><div><br></div><div>Epidemiology</div><div><br></div><div>Picornaviruses are widely prevalent. Enteroviruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, via salivary and respiratory droplets, and in some cases via conjunctival secretions and skin lesion exudates. Cockroaches and flies may be vectors. Rhinoviruses are transmitted by saliva, respiratory discharge, and contaminated inanimate objects. Immunity is serotype specific.</div><div><br></div><div>Diagnosis</div><div><br></div><div>Viruses must be isolated and identified in the clinical laboratory. Serology is used to confirm the virus as the cause of infection and for the assessment of immune status.</div><div><br></div><div>Control</div><div><br></div><div>Poliomyelitis can be prevented by Salk-type (inactivated) and Sabin-type (live) attenuated poliovirus vaccines. Hepatitis A can be prevented by inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix). Control can be achieved via public education on transmission modes and personal hygiene. Adequate sewage disposal and uncontaminated water supplies are critical for prevention of enteroviral infections. There is no specific therapy.</div><div><br></div><div>____________________________________________________________</div><div><br></div><div>RETROVIRUSES</div><div><br></div><div>A type of virus that uses RNA as its genetic material. After infecting a cell, a retrovirus uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA. The retrovirus then integrates its viral DNA into the DNA of the host cell, which allows the retrovirus to replicate. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is a retrovirus. This is how the Virus replicates</div><div><br></div><div>Attachment. The virus binds to a receptor on the surface of the host cell. In the case of HIV, this receptor is found on the surface of immune cells called CD4 T cells.</div><div>Entry. The envelope surrounding the HIV particle fuses with the membrane of the host cell, allowing the virus to enter the cell.</div><div>Reverse transcription. HIV uses its reverse transcriptase enzyme to turn its RNA genetic material into DNA. This makes it compatible with the host cell’s genetic material, which is vital for the next step of the life cycle.</div><div>Genome integration. The newly synthesized viral DNA travels to the cell’s control center, the nucleus. Here, a special viral enzyme called integrase is used to insert the viral DNA into the host cell’s DNA.</div><div>Replication. Once its DNA has been inserted to the host cell’s genome, the virus uses the host cell’s machinery to produce new viral components, such as viral RNA and viral proteins.</div><div>Assembly. The newly made viral components combine close to the cell surface and begin to form new HIV particles.</div><div>Release. The new HIV particles push out from the surface of the host cell, forming a mature HIV particle with the help of another viral enzyme called protease. Once outside the host cell, these new HIV particles can go on to infect other CD4 T cells.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">____________________________________________________________</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>ARENAVIRUS</div><div><br></div><div>Arenaviridae</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Arenaviridae are a family of viruses whose members are generally associated with rodent-transmitted diseases in humans. Each virus usually is associated with a particular rodent host species in which it is maintained. Arenavirus infections are relatively common in humans in some areas of the world and can cause severe illnesses.</div><div><br></div><div>The virus particles are spherical and have an average diameter of 110-130 nanometres. All are enveloped in a lipid (fat) membrane. Viewed in cross-section, they show grainy particles that are ribosomes acquired from their host cells. It is this characteristic that gave them their name, derived from the Latin “arena”, which means “sandy”. Their genome, or genetic material, is composed of RNA only, and while their replication strategy is not completely understood, we know that new viral particles, called virions, are created by budding from the surface of their hosts’ cells.</div><div><br></div><div>Arenavirus history</div><div><br></div><div>The first Arenavirus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), was isolated in 1933 during a study of an epidemic of St. Louis encephalitis. Although not the cause of the outbreak, LCMV was found to be a cause of aseptic (nonbacterial) meningitis. By the 1960s, several similar viruses had been discovered and they were classified into the new family Arenaviridae. Since Tacaribe virus was found in 1956, new Arenavirus have been discovered on the average of every one to three years. A number of Arenavirus have been isolated in rodents only, but few cause hemorrhagic disease. Junin virus, isolated in 1958, was the first of these to be recognized. This virus causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever in a limited agrigultural area of the pampas in Argentina. Several years later, in 1963, in the remote savannas of the Beni province of Bolivia, Machupo virus was isolated. The next member of the virus family to be associated with an outbreak of human illness was Lassa virus in Nigeria in 1969. The most recent additions to these human pathogenic viruses were Guanarito detected in Venezuela in 1989, Sabia in Brazil in 1993, Chapare in Bolivia in 2004, and Lujo in South Africa in 2008.</div><div><br></div><div>Arenaviruses groups</div><div><br></div><div>Arenavirus are divided into two groups: the New World or Tacaribe complex and the Old World or LCM/Lassa complex. Viruses in these groups that cause mild or severe illness in humans and are listed below by date of discovery.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>______________________________</div><div><br></div></div>
